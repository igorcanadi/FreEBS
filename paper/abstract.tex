\begin{abstract}
The primary goal of this project was to create a free, open-source 
implementation of Amazon EBS. We present FreEBS, a distributed virtual block
device that uses chained replication and log-based virtual disks with the 
goals of availability, durability, and reliability in mind. Our backing 
storage also provides the framework for snapshotting, one of
the main features of Amazon EBS that makes it more robust and resilient to
failure. 

We compare our system's performance to the performance of native I/O on a local disk. We find that, for random and mixed random-sequential workloads, FreEBS performs with much higher throughput than local, while for purely sequential workloads it performs much more poorly.

Finally, we argue that FreEBS points the way toward a viable commoditization of replicated block storage, exemplifying a novel model as compared to DRBD or SAN. This model has the potential to lower the cost and increase performance.
