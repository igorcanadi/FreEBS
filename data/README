iometer-file-access-server: the fio file used to run the benchmark

-== iometer benchmark ==-
iometer.remote.cp: This was run with two replicas on mumble-01 and mumble-02 and a client running under
	VirtualBox on mumble-39. Replica files were located in /tmp. Filesystem: ext2
iometer.ext4.cp: Same as iometer.remote.cp except with ext4
iometer.local.cp: This was run on mumble-01 under native Linux in /tmp. Filesystem: ext4

Notes: it seems that we are actually significantly better than local. Possible reasons:
	- we don't fsync every write, so maybe we fsync much less
