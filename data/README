iometer-file-access-server: the fio file used to run the benchmark

-== iometer benchmark ==-
iometer.remote.cp: This was run with two replicas on mumble-01 and mumble-02 and a client running under
	VirtualBox on mumble-39. Replica files were located in /tmp. Filesystem: ext2
iometer.ext4.cp: Same as iometer.remote.cp except with ext4
iometer.local.cp: This was run on mumble-01 under native Linux in /tmp. Filesystem: ext4
iometer.nodio.mumble: Same as iometer.ext4.cp except with directio=0
iometer.3replicas.laptop: Same as iometer.ext4.cp but with 3 replicas and the client running on my
	laptop on CSL's wireless (replicas still in mumble)
iometer.nodio.local: Same as iometer.nodio.mumble but under native linux (still ext4)

-== seqwrite benchmark ==-
seqwrite.freebs: seqwrite with three replicas
seqwrite.local: seqwrite on native Linux, local disk

-== write.ini benchmark ==-
Replica file: 285M before and after cleanup
write.freebs.dat: 3 replicas in mumble lab
write.local.dat: same thing except local

-== read.ini benchmark ==-
Replica file: 285M before and after cleanup
read.freebs.dat: 3 replicas in mumble lab
read.local.dat: same thing except local

-== randw.ini benchmark ==-
Replica file: 
randw.freebs.dat: 3 replicas in mumble lab
randw.local.dat: same thing except local

Notes: it seems that we are actually significantly better than local. Possible reasons:
	- we don't fsync every write, so maybe we fsync much less
